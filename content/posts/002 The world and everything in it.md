For me it's just soo magical that pretty much every technology we use today, was invented just a few decades ago. The world must have been so different back then. Radio technology was introduced about 100 years ago, and nowadays we just take it for granted. Not only that, but we even start to use it less and less, because the internet has advanced this much.

I'm wondering how radio works to be honest, how was any human even able to invent this. Sure...it wasn't just there, but it was a really long process to get there, but how did we do that! And we keep developing so quickly! Can anyone relate to how I feel??

Soo since I don't know what to add to this- I might just talk about what I often do:
I absolutely love to look at the night sky. When the sky is clear and the lights around you are not too bright, and you can look soo far into the universe. I fell in love with the view, and I love to think about how many other people look at the same stars as I'm looking at, in the same moment as I'm looking at them.

I know this sounds obvious, but have you ever thought about the fact that we all look at the same moon everyday. Every human has seen the moon at some point in their lives, and that gives me a feeling of connectivity. It makes me somewhat proud and happy to feel so connected with every other human. Those evening, when I look at the night sky, are exactly the evening when I feel so much hope. I think about how much there is out there, ready for us to explore. I'm not even talking about the universe, I'm talking about planet Earth itself.
You can totally spent a lifetime exploring every place the moonshine is hitting right now, and even then you will only have seen a small portion of the world, and you only stayed on this lovely planet. You haven't been to our closest neighbor Mars, or any other planet in our solar-system. Not only that, you weren't even close to leaving the solar-system, and there has to be so much more in our galaxy.

To sum it up, there is a lot to explore, and we can still learn new things every day. We can write our own stories, we write our life stories and we created memories everyday! Don't you think that's just so awesome! We have the ability to decide. We can decide what we want to do, how we treat others, how we view the world.

I would love to hear what you think about that! So go ahead, tell me!! Make a request on GitHub!!
