Hey, welcome to this lovely little blog. In this blog I'm going to share my thoughts on certain things with you guys! I think that the blog will be somewhat Philosophical, and that I can work things out together with people from all around the world.
I generally think that this is just soo insane about the internet, I know most people feel like this is normal nowadays, but I'm still fascinated like a little kid by the fact that people from far overseas can read this blog...in a matter of seconds!

For me this is just such a absurd thing, I can't imagine how all of this works, especially without any major failures. Anyway, back to the topic... Soo as you might already have noticed I'm fascinated like a little kid, that's exploring the world and let me tell you, we all should be! I think that every human is a kid of the universe, and we're here to explore it, to some extend at least. We're so small compared to literally everything, but still we are being a part of it! We're being a part of the universe and that is my favorite way to think about the universe.

Our time is very limited, but we can use the time we have. The most important thing for me is to make the world just a little nicer for other people. We as humans should be a community after all, despite all the differences we have, we're all human after all, we're all kids of the universe.

Soo I assume now you really see in which direction this blog is going. I hope you enjoy it!
